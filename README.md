cd positiveGPT/
```

## Run the following scripts to start the front end

### `npm start`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

## Run the following scripts to start the simple back end (nodejs)

If you are in positiveGPT/ directory, create a new cmd window in the current directory, type the following
```
cd ../
